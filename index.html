<h1>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science</h1>
<br>
<p id="info">Welcome to Wallace Community College Selma Department of Computer Science. The department is pleased to be a member of WCCS
and offers great learning environments for undergraduate students. The College provides a Computer Information Science curriculum with suitable options 
for students in recognition of the importance of computers and people with computer abilities in today's society. These courses are intended for students who are interested in computer science-related careers at the help desk, networking, web development, applications support, security, cyber defense, or other related sectors.
The ability to type on a keyboard proficiently is required of all students.
The Computer Information Systems program is made to educate graduates for work in businesses that process, manage, and 
communicate information using computers. This curriculum is adaptable and can be tailored to the requirements of the
community information system. A student's capacity to express complicated technical issues relating to computer hardware, 
software, and networks in a way that computer users can understand will be developed through course work. Operating systems,
databases, networking, security, and technical assistance are all topics covered in class.
Graduates should be able to work in entry-level jobs for organizations that rely on computer systems to manage information, such as enterprises, educational institutions, and governmental organizations. If a student aligned all of their courses with Alabama Transfers, they should transfer in as juniors.</p>
